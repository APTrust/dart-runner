DART Runner: Bag and ship files from the command line.

-------
Options
-------

  --job        Path to job json file. Use this option only if you are running
               a single job (as opposed to a workflow). Job json files can
               be exported from the DART UI.
  --workflow   Path to workflow json file. Use this option if you are running
               a workflow against a batch of files. If you specify a workflow
               file, you must also specify --batch. Workflows can be exported
               from the DART UI.
  --batch      Path to CSV batch file. Use this option with --workflow to
               specify a set of files or directories to run through a workflow.
  --output-dir Path to package output directory. Jobs and workflows will create
               bags in this directory. This option is always REQUIRED.
  --delete     Delete bags after job completes? Set this to true or false.
               The default is true for jobs and workflows that include uploads:
               the bags will be deleted after successful uploads. Default is
               false for jobs and workflows that do not include uploads because
               you probably want to do something with the bag after it's
               created.
  --help       Show this help document.


--------
Examples
--------

To run a single job:

    dart-runner --job=path/to/job.json --output-dir=path/to/output

This runs the job described in the job.json file, writing the bag to the
specified output directory.

To run a workflow:

    dart-runner --workflow=path/to/workflow.json  \
                --batch=path/to/batch.csv         \
                --output-dir=path/to/directory    \
                --delete=false

The command above runs all of the items listed in the --batch CSV file through
the workflow described in the --workflow json file. Bags are written to the
output directory. Setting the delete flag to false means the bags will not be
deleted from the output directory after successful upload. Setting --delete
to true (or omitting --delete) will cause bags to be deleted after successful
upload.

To use DART Runner, you typically want to define a job or workflow in the DART
UI, then export it as a json file to be consumed by DART Runner.
