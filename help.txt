DART Runner: Bag and ship files from the command line.

To use DART Runner, you typically want to define a job or workflow in the DART
UI, then export it as a json file to be consumed by DART Runner. See the
Resources section below.

-------
Options
-------

  --workflow     Path to workflow json file. Use this option if you are running
                 a workflow against a batch of files. If you specify a workflow
                 file, you must also specify --batch. Workflows can be exported
                 from the DART UI.

  --batch        Path to CSV batch file. Use this option with --workflow to
                 specify a set of files or directories to run through a
                 workflow.

  --output-dir   Path to package output directory. Jobs and workflows will
                 create bags in this directory. This option is always REQUIRED.

  --delete       Delete bags after job completes? Set this to true or false.
                 The default is true for jobs and workflows that include
                 uploads: the bags will be deleted after successful uploads.
                 Default is false for jobs and workflows that do not include
                 uploads because you probably want to do something with the bag
                 after it's created.

  --concurrency  Number of jobs to run concurrently. Default is 1. Max value
                 for this param should be less than or equal to the number of
                 processors on your machine. You may get diminishing returns
                 when setting this above 2 because most of the DART runner's
                 work is reading from and writing to disk. This setting only
                 makes sense for workflows. For a single job, you can omit
                 this.

  --help         Show this help document.


--------
Examples
--------

If you're running a single job, you can send job params to dart-runner through
STDIN, like this:

    echo '{ json }' | dart-runner --workflow=workflow.json --output-dir=/dir

The job params json tells dart-runner which files to bag and what tag values
to set. The workflow tells dart-runner which BagIt profile to use and where to
send the bag.

You can also feed the contents of a Job Params file to STDIN, like this:

    cat job_params.json | dart-runner --workflow=workflow.json --output-dir=/dir

This runs the job described in the job_params.json file, writing the bag to the
specified output directory.

To run a workflow:

    dart-runner --workflow=path/to/workflow.json  \
                --batch=path/to/batch.csv         \
                --output-dir=path/to/directory    \
                --concurrency=2                   \
                --delete=false

The command above runs all of the items listed in the --batch CSV file through
the workflow described in the --workflow json file. Bags are written to the
output directory. Setting the delete flag to false means the bags will not be
deleted from the output directory after successful upload.

The --concurrency flag above tells DART runner to work on 2 bags at a time
(instead of the default 1 at a time) when bagging and uploading.

Setting --delete to true (or omitting --delete) will cause bags to be deleted
after successful upload.

----------------------
Sample Job Params JSON
----------------------

The following job params tell dart-runner to bag all of the files in
/home/linus/documents and /home/linus/files. This also tells the bagger to
write two tags with the assigned values into the bag-info.txt file and
one tag into the aptrust-info.txt file.

These job params would be combined with a workflow JSON file that would
tell dart runner which BagIt profile to use when creating the bag, and where
to send the bag when it's done.

{
	"packageName": "TestBag.tar",
	"files": [
		"/home/linus/documents",
		"/home/linus/photos"
	],
	"tags": [
		{
			"tagFile": "bag-info.txt",
			"tagName": "Tag-One",
			"value":   "Value One"
		},
		{
			"tagFile": "bag-info.txt",
			"tagName": "Tag-Two",
			"value":   "Value Two"
		},
		{
			"tagFile": "aptrust-info.txt",
			"tagName": "Tag-Three",
			"value": "Value Three"
		}
	]
}
